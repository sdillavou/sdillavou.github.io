I am an experimental physicist working as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania with Douglas Durian and Andrea Liu. I'm primarily interested in the overlap between the physics of complex systems and machine learning, and how the two fields can inform and support one another. 


I study `emergent learning` by building analog electronic systems where learning emerges from a collection of self-adjusting elements rather than being enforced by a processor. They share this property with brains and other biological learning systems, but are simple to control, measure, and modify. As a result they also have enormous potential as an energy-efficient machine learning hardware platform, and blur the lines between computers, materials, and biology: how do we think about a 'computer' that is divisible like clay?


I also use `machine learning as a scientific guide`. I focus on systems that have resisted understanding using standard statistical methods, including  `granular materials` and `frictional interfaces`. To make this kind of experimental research easier and more accessible, I develop easy-to-use deep-learning software packages.
